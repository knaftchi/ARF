A challenge in transcranial focused ultrasound is improving spatial resolution without sacrificing energy deposition at the target deep within the brain. Moreover, better dynamic control over the target, that is, knowledge of the acoustic radiation force magnitude and direction, as well as being able to control the polarity of the pressures applied on the target, are crucial in accurate mapping of ultrasound input parameters to neural population output signals (this could also extend to behavioral response). In this research project we introduce the underlying theory as well as simulations supporting all of the above mentioned factors. ```ARF``` notebook only contains the theoretical work underlining the computations of acoustic radiation force, where for the first time we have applied these to the case of orthogonal pair of transducers. This work is in the process of submission.
